# libasm
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture’s machine code instructions. The library must be called libasm.a. You must rewrite the following functions in asm:
◦ _ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)_

◦ _ft_strcpy (man 3 strcpy)_

◦ _ft_strcmp (man 3 strcmp)_

◦ _ft_write (man 2 write)_

◦ _ft_read (man 2 read)_\n
◦ _ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)_
